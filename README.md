# Stock-Price-Prediction

Exploring thea area of TimeSeries Analysis with Stock Price Prediction. Though it is similiar to other machine learning based prediction but here the key thing is to see the data in a sequential manner. For that, data trend and time time duration both play their part. With regular regression based techniques, LSTM which is a variation of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) also can be used. 

LSTM's remember and forget gate helps in observing the trebd and time duration for future prediction.

Explored Techniques:
  1. Moving Average
  2. Linear Regression
  3. k-Nearest Neighbors
  4. Auto ARIMA
  5. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
  
Above algorithms can be explored further and there will be plenty of other algorithms available and can be used with the domain expertise.
